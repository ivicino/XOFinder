# XOFinder
XOFinder:  This program was an attempt to develop an application to help my lab with our data analysis. The goal was to automate the search for viral exocytosis events. Unfortunately it didn't work that well on real life data, but it was a worthwhile attempt :).   I developed it into a CLI program as well, which you can find here. I made a GUI too, but that I cannot upload to GitHub.
